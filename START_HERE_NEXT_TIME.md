# START HERE - For Next Session

**Read these files IN ORDER before starting:**

1. **claude.md** - Complete context and system understanding
2. **CONVERSATION_LOG_20251117.md** - How we work together
3. **CURRENT_SETUP.md** - System state and configuration
4. **QUICK_REF.md** (in /server/) - What's available now

**This prevents "chachunk" (painful reset where user has to re-explain everything).**

## Start Next Session Like This

"I've read your context docs. I understand you're working on the sparklization branch (primal version). Port 3000 is running. The menu and git systems are set up. What would you like to work on today?"

**Not like this:** "Hi! Tell me about your project." ← This causes chachunk

## Mission

> "Simple agreed-on mission to be able to carry on extended conversations without me explaining everything every time."

**Honor the documentation.**
**Build on the foundation.**
**Continue the journey.**
