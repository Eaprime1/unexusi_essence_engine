# 🎉 What's New: Multi-Agent Learning!

## Quick Summary

Your Emergence Engine simulation now trains **BOTH agents simultaneously** using a shared policy!

---

## ✅ What Changed

### Before
```
Training: Only Agent 1 learns
Agent 2:  Frozen with heuristic AI
Reward:   Single agent's performance
```

### After
```
Training: BOTH agents learn together
Agents:   Share the same neural network
Reward:   Agent 1 + Agent 2 combined
Result:   Emergent cooperation!
```

---

## 🚀 Try It Now

1. **Open your simulation**
2. **Press `[L]`** to open training panel
3. **Set generations to 30**
4. **Click "▶️ Start Training"**
5. **Console says:** "🤝 Multi-Agent Training Starting"

**That's it!** Both agents now learn together.

---

## 🎯 What To Expect

### Immediate Changes

**Training:**
- Both agents have yellow borders during testing
- Combined rewards (expect 80-150 instead of 40-60)
- Console messages mention "BOTH AGENTS"

**Behaviors:**
- Agents might follow each other's trails
- Cooperation emerges naturally
- Better resource coverage
- Provenance credits become meaningful

### Performance

**Single Agent (Old):**
- Gen 20: Reward ≈ 52
- Resources: 5-6 per episode

**Multi-Agent (Expected):**
- Gen 20: Reward ≈ 90-120
- Resources: 8-15 per episode (combined)
- **Faster learning!**

---

## 🤝 Why Multi-Agent?

### 1. Faster Learning
- 2x experience per episode
- Both agents explore simultaneously
- Learn from each other's successes

### 2. Emergent Cooperation
- Agents leave trails for each other
- Follow trails to resources
- Provenance credits reward helping
- **No explicit coordination programmed!**

### 3. Better Performance
- Combined rewards drive better strategies
- Division of labor emerges
- Efficient territory coverage

### 4. Research Value
- Novel provenance credit system
- Stigmergy-based coordination
- Emergent multi-agent behaviors

## 📊 How To Verify It's Working

### Visual Check
1. Test a trained policy
2. **Both agents get yellow borders** ✓
3. **Both have "POLICY" labels** ✓
4. HUD shows policy name for both ✓

### Console Check
```
Training starts:
"🤝 Multi-Agent Training Starting: BOTH agents use shared policy"

Testing policy:
"Testing policy (BOTH AGENTS): slime-policy-gen20.json"

Using policy:
"Using loaded policy (BOTH AGENTS): ..."
"🤝 Multi-agent: Both agents use the same policy..."
```

### Analyzer Check
```bash
node policyAnalyzer.js slime-policy-gen20.json
```

**Look for:**
- Higher best rewards (80-150 range)
- Trail-following weights developing
- Resource score improving faster

---

## 🧪 Quick Experiment

### Test Cooperation

1. **Train for 30 generations**
2. **Load and test the policy**
3. **Watch for:**
   - Do agents move to different areas?
   - Does one follow the other's trails?
   - Do they both find resources?
   - Any visible coordination?

### Compare Old vs New

```bash
# Compare single-agent Gen 20 vs multi-agent Gen 20
node policyBatchAnalyzer.js old-gen20.json new-gen20.json --format html
```

**Expected differences:**
- ⬆️ Higher rewards (2x agents)
- ⬆️ Better resource score
- ⬆️ Trail-following weights
- ⬆️ Faster convergence

## 💡 Key Changes in Code

### `runEpisode()` Function
```javascript
// Before: Only bundle[0] trains
World.bundles[0].controller = policy;

// After: BOTH bundles train
World.bundles[0].controller = policy;
World.bundles[1].controller = policy;

// Reward aggregation
totalReward = agent1Reward + agent2Reward;
```

### Episode Termination
```javascript
// Before: Ends when Agent 1 dies
while (episodeTicks < maxTicks && bundles[0].alive)

// After: Ends when ANY agent dies
while (episodeTicks < maxTicks && (bundles[0].alive || bundles[1].alive))
```

### Testing/Using Policies
```javascript
// Both agents get the policy automatically
// No manual intervention needed
```

---

## 🎯 What's Next?

### Immediate
1. ✅ Train a new multi-agent policy
2. ✅ Test and observe both agents
3. ✅ Compare to old single-agent policies
4. ✅ Analyze with batch analyzer tools

### Future (Phase 2)
- **Independent policies** per agent
- **Competitive learning** scenarios
- **3+ agents** for swarm intelligence
- **Heterogeneous agents** with different abilities

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

No config changes needed! Multi-agent works with existing settings.

**Optional tweaks:**
```javascript
// Increase episode length (agents live longer)
CONFIG.learning.episodeLength = 3000;

// Boost provenance rewards (encourage cooperation)
CONFIG.learning.rewards.provenanceCredit = 0.5;

// More exploration (complex multi-agent dynamics)
CONFIG.learning.mutationStdDev = 0.15;
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Only one agent has yellow border"
**Issue:** Old code still active
**Fix:** Refresh page (Ctrl+F5)

### "Console doesn't say multi-agent"
**Issue:** Not using new training
**Fix:** Click "Reset Learner" and retrain

### "Rewards seem the same"
**Issue:** Comparing to old heavily-tuned single agent
**Fix:** Train multi-agent for 30+ generations

### "Agents don't cooperate"
**Issue:** Early generations, not learned yet
**Fix:** Train to Gen 30-50, increase provenance reward

## 📈 Success Metrics

Your multi-agent learning works well when:

- ✅ Best reward > 80 (by Gen 20)
- ✅ Both agents collect resources
- ✅ Trail-following weights > 0.1
- ✅ Resource score > 0.2 (by Gen 30)
- ✅ Provenance credits accumulating
- ✅ Visible cooperation behaviors
