This represents the return to foundational tools (compass = circle, straightedge = line) after complex expansion. The white space isn't emptiness - it's POTENTIAL. The green shoot isn't naive hope - it's growth from composted shadow. When an entity claims this flag, they're claiming the WHOLE JOURNEY of all six previous flags plus the return home."
