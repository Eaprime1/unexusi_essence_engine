## 🎯 Quick Start

### Scenario 1: "Did my training work?"

```bash
# After training to Gen 50
node policyAnalyzer.js slime-policy-gen50.json
```

Look for:
- **Resource-Seeking Score > 0.3** = Success! ✓
- **Resource-Seeking Score < 0.1** = Needs more training ✗

### Scenario 2: "Compare my progress"

```bash
# Get HTML report
node policyBatchAnalyzer.js slime-policy-gen10.json slime-policy-gen20.json slime-policy-gen30.json --format html

# Open policy-comparison.html in browser
```

**Visual charts show:**
- Learning curves
- Resource-seeking progression
- Convergence status

### Scenario 3: "Share results with team"

```bash
# Generate all formats
node policyBatchAnalyzer.js gen*.json --format csv --output results.csv
node policyBatchAnalyzer.js gen*.json --format html --output results.html

# Share the HTML file - it's self-contained!
```

## 🔍 Key Metrics Explained

### Resource-Seeking Score
**Most important metric for your issue!**

- **< 0.1**: ✗ Policy ignores resources (your Gen 6, 8, 20)
- **0.1-0.3**: ⚠ Sometimes seeks resources
- **> 0.3**: ✓ Actively seeks resources (GOAL!)

### Collapsed Percentage
Shows how "stuck" the policy is

- **< 50%**: ✓ Still exploring
- **50-80%**: ⚠ Converging
- **> 80%**: ✗ Stuck in local optimum (your Gen 20!)

### Best Reward
Overall performance

- **< 0**: Dying before collecting resources
- **0-20**: Collecting 1-2 resources
- **20-50**: Good performance (2-5 resources)
- **> 50**: Excellent! (5+ resources)

---

## 🎓 Your Specific Results

Based on your Gen 6 vs 20 analysis:

### Current Status
```
Gen  6: Reward = 11.38, ResourceScore = 0.073 ✗ Weak
Gen  8: Reward = -24.47, ResourceScore = 0.056 ✗ Weak  
Gen 20: Reward = 22.18, ResourceScore = 0.017 ✗ Even worse!
```

### The Problem
- Reward doubled (good!)
- But resource-seeking score dropped by 76%! (bad!)
- Gen 20 is 65% collapsed (stuck!)

### What Happened
1. Policy learned to survive (avoid walls, manage chi)
2. Got lucky a few times finding resources
3. Converged on "survival" strategy before learning "seeking"
4. Now stuck in local optimum

### The Fix
**Increase resource reward dramatically:**
```javascript
CONFIG.learning.rewards.collectResource = 50.0  // was 10.0
```

Or **train Gen 20 for 50 more generations** with increased mutation:
```javascript
CONFIG.learning.mutationStdDev = 0.25  // was 0.1
```

## 🚀 Workflow Recommendation

### After Every Training Session:

1. **Quick Check:**
   ```bash
   node policyAnalyzer.js slime-policy-gen{X}.json
   ```
   - Is resource score improving?
   - Is convergence healthy?

2. **Track Progress:**
   ```bash
   node policyBatchAnalyzer.js slime-policy-gen*.json
   ```
   - See trends at a glance
   - Spot when learning plateaus

3. **Export Milestones:**
   ```bash
   # Every 20-30 generations
   node policyBatchAnalyzer.js gen*.json --format html --output milestone-gen{X}.html
   ```

4. **Final Analysis:**
   ```bash
   # When training complete
   node policyBatchAnalyzer.js gen*.json --format csv --output final-results.csv
   # Analyze in Excel, create publication-ready graphs
   ```

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Save policies every 10 generations** during training
2. **Name files systematically**: `slime-policy-gen{XX}.json`
3. **Keep a training log** noting hyperparameter changes
4. **Export HTML reports** before major changes
5. **Version control** successful policies in git
6. **Compare experiments** using batch analyzer
7. **Watch resource score** - it's your main metric!

---

## 🎯 Success Checklist

Your training is successful when:
- ✅ Resource-Seeking Score > 0.3
- ✅ Best Reward > 50
- ✅ Collapsed Pct < 70%
- ✅ Learning curve trending upward
- ✅ `thrust_resVis` weight > 0.2
- ✅ Agent visibly seeks resources in simulation

You're not there yet with Gen 20, but now you have the tools to:
1. **Understand** exactly what's wrong (resource score = 0.017)
2. **Track** improvements over time (batch analyzer)
3. **Diagnose** issues early (convergence warnings)
4. **Share** results professionally (HTML reports)

## 🎓 What You've Learned

You now understand:
1. ✅ Why Gen 20 ignores resources (score = 0.017)
2. ✅ What the 48 weights represent (obs × actions + biases)
3. ✅ How CEM learns (sample, evaluate, select elites, update)
4. ✅ What convergence means (sigma collapse)
5. ✅ How to track progress (batch analyzer)
6. ✅ How to export for analysis (CSV/JSON/HTML)
7. ✅ What good policies look like (resource score > 0.3)

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Increase resource reward** in `config.js`
2. **Train to Gen 50+** (resource-seeking emerges later)
3. **Analyze every 10 generations** with batch analyzer
4. **Export HTML reports** at milestones
5. **Share findings** using beautiful reports

Your prototype is sophisticated! The learning system works - policies just need better reward signals or more training to discover resource-seeking behavior.

**Happy analyzing! 📊🧠🚀**
