# Scent Gradient Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Was Implemented

I've successfully implemented a comprehensive **scent gradient reward system** for your Essence Engine simulation. Here's what's been added:

### 1. 🌸 Scent Gradient Field System

**New File:** `scentGradient.js`

- Resources emit "scent" that decreases with distance
- Multiple falloff types: linear, inverse, inverse-square, exponential
- Agents can sense scent intensity and gradient direction
- Supports multiple resources with additive scent fields

**Key Functions:**
- `calculateScentIntensity(distance)` - Compute scent at a point
- `getScentGradient(x, y, resources)` - Get gradient vector at position
- `getFoodDensitySensing(x, y, resources)` - Multi-scale density sensing
- `visualizeScentGradient()` - Debug visualization
- `visualizeScentHeatmap()` - Heatmap visualization

### 2. 🎯 Distance-Based Rewards

**Updated:** `rewards.js`

- New reward component: `gradientClimb`
- Tracks distance to nearest food over time
- Rewards agents for getting closer (pixels moved × scale)
- Configurable update interval to reduce noise

**Formula:**
```javascript
if (got closer) {
  reward = pixelsCloser × CONFIG.learning.rewards.gradientClimb
}
```

### 3. 🔭 Multi-Scale Food Density Sensing

**Updated:** `observations.js`

Observation vector expanded from **15 → 23 dimensions**:

**New observations:**
- Scent intensity (1 dim)
- Scent gradient direction X, Y (2 dims)
- Food density near/mid/far (3 dims)
- Density direction X, Y (2 dims)

This gives agents:
- "How strong is the scent here?"
- "Which way should I go?"
- "Are there more resources northeast-ish?"

### 4. ⚙️ Configuration System

**Updated:** `config.js`

New configuration section:
```javascript
scentGradient: {
  enabled: true,
  maxRange: 400,
  falloffType: 'inverse-square',
  strength: 1.0,
  
  // Distance rewards
  rewardEnabled: true,
  rewardScale: 0.5,
  rewardUpdateInterval: 10,
  
  // Multi-scale sensing
  densitySensingEnabled: true,
  densityRadiusNear: 200,
  densityRadiusMid: 400,
  densityRadiusFar: 600,
}
```

Also updated:
- `learning.observationDims: 23` (was 15)
- `learning.rewards.gradientClimb: 2.0` (new component)

### 5. 🎨 Visualization

**Updated:** `app.js`

- Press **[G]** to toggle scent gradient visualization
- Shows heatmap (green intensity) + vector field (arrows)
- Real-time rendering shows what agents sense
- HUD updated with [G] control and status

### 6. 🔌 Integration

**Updated:** `app.js`

- All `buildObservation()` calls now pass `resources` array
- All `computeStepReward()` calls now pass `resources` array
- Learner initialized with 23 dimensions (was 15)
- Visualization integrated into render loop

## 🎮 How To Use

### Quick Start

1. **Open your simulation** (load `index.html`)
2. **Press [G]** to see the scent gradient visualization
3. Watch agents follow the gradient toward food!

### Visualization

Press **[G]** to toggle scent gradient display:
- **Green heatmap**: Shows scent intensity
- **White arrows**: Show gradient direction
- Brighter = stronger signal

### Training New Agents

**Important:** Old policies won't work (dimension mismatch). To train new policies:

1. Press **[L]** to open training UI
2. Click **"Reset Learner"** (clears old policy)
3. Click **"Start Training"** with desired generations
4. Watch agents learn to follow gradients!

### Tuning

Edit `config.js` → `scentGradient` section:

- **Stronger gradients:** Increase `rewardScale` (try 1.0-2.0)
- **Longer range:** Increase `maxRange` (500-800)
- **Different falloff:** Try 'linear', 'inverse', 'exponential'
- **Less noise:** Increase `rewardUpdateInterval` (20-30)

## 🎯 Expected Improvements

With scent gradients enabled, you should see:

### Behavioral Changes
- ✅ More direct paths to food (less wandering)
- ✅ Better coverage (agents spread out to find resources)
- ✅ Faster adaptation to resource movement
- ✅ More "natural" foraging behavior

### Training Improvements
- ✅ Faster convergence (fewer generations needed)
- ✅ Higher collection rates
- ✅ Better generalization to new environments
- ✅ More stable policies

### Reward Statistics
- Monitor `gradientClimb` rewards in training output
- Should see positive values when agents approach food
- Collection reward (500) should still dominate total

## 🔬 Technical Notes

### Observation Vector (23 dims)

```javascript
[
  chi, frustration, alive,           // 0-2: state
  vx, vy,                             // 3-4: motion
  wallNx, wallNy, wallMag,            // 5-7: walls
  resDx, resDy, resVisible,           // 8-10: resource
  trailMean, trailMax, trailDirX, trailDirY,  // 11-14: trails
  scentIntensity, scentGradX, scentGradY,      // 15-17: scent (NEW)
  densityNear, densityMid, densityFar,         // 18-20: density (NEW)
  densityDirX, densityDirY            // 21-22: density dir (NEW)
]
```

### Reward Calculation

Total reward per step = sum of:
1. Collection: 500.0 × (collected flag)
2. Chi gain: 0.5 × (chi gained from trails)
3. Chi spend: -0.1 × (chi spent)
4. Stuck: -0.8 × (stuck flag)
5. Idle: -0.2 × (idle flag)
6. Explore: 10.0 × (new cell visited)
7. Provenance: 1.0 × (credits from others)
8. **Gradient climb: 2.0 × (pixels closer)** ← NEW
9. Death: -50.0 × (died flag)

### Scent Falloff Functions

- **linear**: `1 - (d / maxRange)`
- **inverse**: `1 / (1 + k×d)`
- **inverse-square**: `1 / (1 + k×d²)` (default, physics-like)
- **exponential**: `e^(-λ×d)`

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Start with defaults** - They're tuned for typical arena sizes
2. **Use visualization** - Press [G] to debug agent behavior
3. **Monitor rewards** - Check console for gradient climb rewards
4. **Train from scratch** - Old policies incompatible (dimension change)
5. **Experiment with falloff** - Different types for different behaviors

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate
1. Load simulation and press [G] to see gradients
2. Watch agents follow the scent field
3. Start training to see learning improvements

### Advanced
1. Tune `rewardScale` for your arena size
2. Try different `falloffType` settings
3. Adjust `maxRange` for different difficulty
4. Compare learning curves with/without gradients

### Optional Enhancements
- Add scent "dispersion" that spreads over time
- Implement scent "masking" (closer scents hide distant ones)
- Add agent-specific scent preferences
- Create scent "trails" separate from chi trails

## 🎉 Conclusion

You now have three powerful mechanisms working together:

1. **Scent Field** - Continuous signal to follow
2. **Distance Rewards** - Progress-based learning signal
3. **Density Sensing** - Strategic navigation hints

This creates a rich learning environment where agents can learn to:
- Navigate efficiently using gradients
- Balance local vs global information
- Exhibit natural foraging behaviors

**Everything is integrated and ready to use. Press [G] and watch the magic!** ✨
